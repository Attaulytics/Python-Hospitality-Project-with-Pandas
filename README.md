## 💡 Project Overview

AtliQ, a reputed hotel chain, was looking for a data-driven approach to understand its operations and financial performance. As part of this project, I analyzed the provided business data to extract actionable insights using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

The primary goals of the project were:

- 🏷️ Cleaning and transforming real-world business data.
- 📊 Visualizing trends, outliers, and business patterns.
- 💡 Deriving insights on occupancy rates, revenue streams, and seasonal trends.
- 💾 Exporting refined results for business use.

## 🔥 Key Features

- **Data Wrangling:** Converted raw datasets into meaningful, analysis-ready DataFrames.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Used charts like bar plots, pie charts, line plots to visualize sales, occupancy, and booking trends.
- **Aggregation & Grouping:** Leveraged `groupby()` and pivot tables to summarize business performance.
- **Data Cleaning:** Ensured proper data types, removed duplicates, and handled missing values.
- **Occupancy Rate Calculations:** Calculated and converted occupancy rates into percentage format for easy interpretation.
- **Export Ready Reports:** Prepared structured outputs, including JSON export for easy system integration.
